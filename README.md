This is the Dendron vault containing the stub notes.
The ones ready to be published will be sent to the one inside [mockblog](https://github.com/AndreaBinelli/mockblog).

## Concepts

- New notes will be created in this vault
- From stubs to well written notes, then moved to the mockblog vault when I want to publish them
- Can be private (in this case it isn't because it's the proof of concept...)
-
